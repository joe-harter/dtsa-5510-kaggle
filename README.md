This repository is a companion to the PDF I posted for Week 4 of Unsupervised Learning at The University of Colorado Boulder. The same PDF is attached here, but may be an updated version from my original upload.

To run this repository I recommend setting up a python environment with conda


This project uses Python 3.10. Create an environment with

```bash
conda create -n kaggle python=3.10
```

Activate the virtual environment with

```bash
conda activate kaggle
```

Install all python dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The necessary data for this project can be downloaded from the kaggle project https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learn-ai-bbc/data and should be placed in the data folder.
